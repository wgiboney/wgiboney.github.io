As part of my 2022 goals / new years resolution / whatever you may call it ….more connections and experiences with friends and family is on my list.  Too often I feel I go too long without talking to people that matter to me.  This is something that I've been working on the past couple of years…scheduling standing trips with friends (the best!), creating annual family traditions, regularly reaching out to friends to grab lunch and connect.  But…I'm going to turn that up even more this year. 

 

One of the podcast hosts I've recently started tuning into references this topic [1].  Good listen and well said in the closing part of the podcast.
