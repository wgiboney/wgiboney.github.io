This is a podcast I listen to from time to time.  I enjoy the format and the topics.  A couple of my favorite episodes are their view on the year ahead and trends.

Equipment:
- Jabra Headset
This headset is awesome!  I'm on way more teams calls now than before and a quality headset is a must.  It eliminates background noise and by just moving the mic away from your face mutes you.

- Wrist rest
This is a tip that came from another developer in the office (shout out Pranay).  It was a little awkward the first couple of weeks getting used to them, but my wrists feel better after a long day.  I'm thankful that the really only work place injury I can think of as a developer is wrist isues :)
