Preface:  So I recently started on a new team that is based in Kansas City, California and India.  I'm the only one located on the team in the KC office, so getting to know other members on the team is different.  I posted the article below on my internal blog in an effort to connect better with my team.  Let's see how it goes!


--Post--

I found a post about how remote teams can connect and get to know each other better [1] and thought it would be a good idea.  Have a good idea....do it right !?!?!?!!?

Below are 10 things about me.  Enjoy!

**1.** I have two awesome [kids](../../../assets/img/h_and_e.jpg) and we enjoy family adventures.  Our current adventure is fostering  some [puppies](../../../assets/img/puppy_foster.jpg) for a local dog shelter (KCPetProject).  We also have a full time pup by the name of [Rosie](../../../assets/img/rosie.jpg)

**2.** I'm a huge fan of music.  I enjoy finding new music and attending concerts in my free time.

**3.** I enjoy collecting quotes.  I find it inspiring and enjoy looking back over them.  Here is [one](../../../assets/img/quote.png) that I found on an old gas station wall.

**4.** I enjoy exercise and fitness...all kinds.  Most recently, I've completed several triathlons and hoping to get into the Escape from Alcatraz race.

**5.** Jif (creamy of course) peanut butter is a favorite

**6.** I overuse the word awesome, but mean it when I say it

**7.** I'm all about new experiences (I consider this project one) and always up for an adventure

**8.** My Meyers Briggs type is INTJ

**9.** I love to problem solve and enjoy finding multiple solutions to a problem

**10.** I try to have a positive attitude towards everything. I'm very much a glass half full person
