Another year older another year wiser?  2025 was such a great and blessed year.  It was a year that can only be outdone by 2026!

### January
#### Steamboat Music Fest
The year kicked off with a pretty intense snow storm in Kansas City.  I was scheduled to drive out to Steamboat Co for an annual trip to the Steamboat Music Festival.  And lets just say that for about 150 miles I had I-70 all to myself :)
Another great music festival out in Steamboat.  One of my favorite artists, Charlie Robison, passed away the previous year.  One of my favorite sessions was when artists told stories about Charlie and then played a song.

#### Passing of a fellow Sigma Nu
#### Trip to NYC
Bethany, Drake and I had a great to NYC.  Walked a ton, saw one of the stranger thing actors, good food, exploring and met up with E!  He was in town at the same time.  One of my favorite stories from the trip was when we were planning on meeting E at Grand Central station....We walked in saw him immediately!  Was fun to think about all of the people there and then just seeing him right off the start.  We also had an experience when driving back to the airport in our cab.  "Are you fucking kidding me!"
