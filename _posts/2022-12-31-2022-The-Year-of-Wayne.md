Early in 2022 I coined it the Year of Wayne (trademark pending)...I kept track of work outs and posted highlights of the month on a calendar I see every day.  Really enjoyed the year and the adventures! 

Some of the highlights were

Some great trips to Austin (twice), Salt Lake City (twice), skiing in Crested Butte and Whistler, Steamboat 
Memorable Concerts with friends Zach Bryan (twice) the return of Turnpike Troubadours (twice), Wade Bowen, Flatland Carvery, Casey Donahue and the best....Tater and the Gravy Train
Experiences, test kitchen (twice!), new cocktail places with friends 
Fitness has been awesome this year, I started playing tennis and had my first W in November
Celebrated multiple birthday with friends and was surprised by my friends (Bethany, Chad, KO) for my own party!  Such a great memory!
