Over the last weekend, I had the opportunity to see one of my favorite bands upon their return to touring.  The lead singer had a bit of a melt down a couple of years ago (blame marinda lambert) and its taken them some time to get it back together.  They opened up tours this year at Red Rocks, but tickets were just dumb level of money.  So...sandstone it is.  It was such a great show and they played hit after hit.  My friends and I had a blast and are so glad to have them back.  Looking forward to the next chapter.
