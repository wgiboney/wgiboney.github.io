I've been working with a coworker on a configuration issue that was causing issues in our UAT and Prod environments.  In debugging through the issue late yesterday we found the root cause and corrected it in QA and tested.  Wanting to push it to prod as soon as possible changes were to UAT and after successful testing it was pushed on to prod.  

 

Issue Solved!  Which is awesome.  I had a quick debrief with a teammate this morning (day after) and told him about the deployment.  

 

He said...'So you just Leeroy Jenkins'd it?'

 

Not knowing the reference I explained our testing and then he shared the [World of Warcraft video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4)

 

...I'm still laughing!
